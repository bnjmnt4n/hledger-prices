# hledger-prices

A CLI utility to obtain given stock prices and currency exchange rates from the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/), and print them out in [hledgerâ€™s price format](https://hledger.org/1.28/hledger.html#declaring-market-prices).

## Installation

With Go:

```sh
$ go install github.com/bnjmnt4n/hledger-prices@latest
```

For Nix users:

```sh
$ nix run github:bnjmnt4n/hledger-prices
```

## Usage

```sh
$ hledger-prices -alphavantage-key $ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY -base-currency SGD -currencies USD,ETH -stocks VT,VWRA.LON -delay 15
```

This command will get the most recent exchange rates between SGD/USD and SGD/ETH and stock prices of VT and VWRA (in the London exchange), with a delay of 15 seconds between requests.

Note:
- only the records for the most recent day are fetched.
- the following APIs are used: [stock latest price](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#latestprice), [stock search endpoint](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#symbolsearch) and [currency exchange](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#currency-exchange).
- the free Alpha Vantage API only allows 5 requests per minute, so you might want to add a delay between requests.
